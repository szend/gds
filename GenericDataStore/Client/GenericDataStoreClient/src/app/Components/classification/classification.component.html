    AI data classification is the process of using artificial intelligence to organize and categorize data based on predetermined criteria, enabling efficient data retrieval and analysis.
</p>
<p>
    The ultimate goal of AI data classification is to automate the process of organizing data, making it easier to access and analyze.
</p>
